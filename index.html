          I was born in Delhi. I belong from UK. B) (uttarakhand).
          I can draw very well,but I got beaten for not writing an essay on cow once. I mean, I could have drawn the cow
          as well. It would have served the purpose. But this cruel society chose to torment me, just because I didn't
          write some pathetic words.
          <br>
          I got a pair of mice once. They turned out to be male and female and boom!! Next day they had 20 of them. I
          want a dog now.
          <br>
          I like intellectual movies. Don't even try to show me superhero shit and cringey love stories.

          I'm a ladies man. I have a cool girlfriend. She looks pretty hot too. She is the cutest and smartest of all my
          exes. :) I don't say it everyday, but I love her so much.
